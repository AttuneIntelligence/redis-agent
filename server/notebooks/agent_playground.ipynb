However, pure SSM-based models still face challenges related to stability and achieving optimal performance on computer vision tasks. Our paper addresses the challenges of scaling SSM-based models for computer vision, particularly the instability and inefficiency of large model sizes. To address this, we introduce a Modulated Group Mamba layer which divides the input channels into four groups and applies our proposed SSM-based efficient Visual Single Selective Scanning (VSSS) block independently to each group, with each VSSS block scanning in one of the four spatial directions. The Modulated Group Mamba layer also wraps the four VSSS blocks into a channel modulation operator to improve cross-channel communication. Furthermore, we introduce a distillation-based training objective to stabilize the training of large models, leading to consistent performance gains. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed contributions, leading to superior performance over existing methods for image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection, instance segmentation on MS-COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our tiny variant with 23M parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance with a classification top-1 accuracy of 83.3% on ImageNet-1K, while being 26% efficient in terms of parameters, compared to the best existing Mamba design of same model size.

While previous methods achieved commendable results through inter-domain consistency losses, they often assumed unrealistic simultaneous access to images from all target domains, overlooking constraints such as data transfer bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. Given these challenges, we pose the question: How to merge models adapted independently on distinct domains while bypassing the need for direct access to training data? Our solution to this problem involves two components, merging model parameters and merging model buffers (i.e., normalization layer statistics). For merging model parameters, empirical analyses of mode connectivity surprisingly reveal that linear merging suffices when employing the same pretrained backbone weights for adapting separate models. For merging model buffers, we model the real-world distribution with a Gaussian prior and estimate new statistics from the buffers of separately trained models. Our method is simple yet effective, achieving comparable performance with data combination training baselines, while eliminating the need for accessing training data.

Forty adult patients with non-metastatic prostate or breast cancer, newly diagnosed or undergoing treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy), were recruited.

Using evidence-based mindfulness-based mobile interventions as a case example, the goal of this study was to identify key patient-, provider-, and organization-level barriers and facilitators to supportive care and implementing digital health interventions in AYA survivorship care.\\nTwenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders including AYA survivors (n=10; between 18-29years old) and clinical providers and administrators (n=10). Interviews were transcribed and deductively mapped using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) complementary frameworks.\\nResults indicated that factors like cost and patients' needs and resources were prevalent among both survivors and providers. There were key differences between providers and AYA survivors. Providers' adoption and promotion of digital health interventions were influenced most strongly by contextual factors, including available resources (Inner Setting), culture (Outer Setting), and networks and communications (Outer Setting). On the other hand, survivors emphasized individual and intervention-related factors; they reported that social influence and knowledge influenced their adoption and use of digital health interventions, including meditation apps.\\nThese results identified barriers and facilitators to the adoption of supportive care digital health interventions from multiple stakeholders. Results can be used to guide the development of implementation strategies to improve the uptake of digital health interventions in survivorship care, ultimately improving the psychosocial well-being of AYA cancer survivors.\",\n",

       " {'Psilocybin-facilitated Smoking Cessation Treatment: A Pilot Study': {'description': 'One of the most promising lines of investigation for the therapeutic use of hallucinogens in the 1960s and 1970s was in the treatment of drug dependence. The investigators propose to examine psilocybin administration combined with a structured smoking cessation treatment program in nicotine dependent individuals in order to provide preliminary data on the efficacy of this combined treatment for smoking cessation. Prior work in the investigators laboratory has shown that under carefully prepared and supportive conditions, psilocybin administration can facilitate highly salient experiences with enduring personal meaning and spiritual significance. It is plausible that embedding such highly meaningful experiences into a drug dependence cessation attempt may provide an enduring motivation for remaining abstinent. Cigarette smoking is a good model system for studying drug dependence because users are less likely to be challenged by the many social and economic impairments that often accompany dependence on other drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or alcohol. More specifically, the investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled comparative efficacy study in which either psilocybin or transdermal nicotine patch are administered under highly supportive conditions to individuals who are nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers, who have had multiple unsuccessful quit attempts, and who continue to desire to quit smoking. Other than nicotine dependence, participants will be healthy. Fifteen participants have already completed a preliminary open-label pilot-study with no control condition. Eighty additional participants will be enrolled and randomized to either psilocybin (n=40), or nicotine patch (n=40) treatment. Participants will receive a 13-week course of cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation, with Target Quit Date set for week 5. After several preparation meetings with study monitors, participants will have either a single day-long psilocybin session using a high dose (30 mg/70 kg), or a standard 8 to 10-week course of nicotine patch treatment. Participant smoking status will be assessed repeatedly for 8 weeks after the Target Quit Date, including biological verification of smoking status through breath and urine samples. Smoking status will also be assessed at three follow up sessions approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after the Target Quit Date. Additionally, 50 of these participants (25 per treatment condition) will undergo MRI scanning before and after Target Quit Date to assess the brain-based mechanisms associated with these treatments. Individuals assigned to the nicotine patch study treatment condition will be eligible to undergo an optional high dose psilocybin session after completing the 6-month follow-up meeting.',\n",

The dynamic methodology facilitates the correlation of the fractal dimension with both the entropic index and the urban scaling exponent identified in data analyses. The results reveal that the scaling behaviour observed in cities aligns with the fractal dimension measured through independent methods. Moreover, the interpretation of these findings underscores the intimate connection between the fractal dimension and social interactions within the urban context.

This restriction no longer applies for more general identically coupled oscillators. Hence, it is interesting to understand precisely how frequency synchrony is lost and how invariant sets such as attracting weak chimeras are generated at torus breakup, where the phase description breaks down. Maistrenko et al (2016) found numerical evidence of an organizing center for weak chimeras in a system of $N=3$ coupled identical Kuramoto oscillators with inertia. This paper identifies this organizing center and shows that it corresponds to a particular type of non-transverse heteroclinic bifurcation that is generic in the context of symmetry. At this codimension two bifurcation there is a splitting of connecting orbits between the in-phase (fully synchronized) state. This generates a wide variety of associated bifurcations to weak chimeras. We further highlight a second organizing center associated with a codimension two symmetry-breaking heteroclinic connection.',\n",
